Events with a lepton, missing transverse momentum, and two jets are selected and the invariant mass of the corresponding final state is reconstructed. The search exploits the shape of the tb invariant mass distribution compared to the expected standard model backgrounds. The model of a right-handed W′R with standard model-like couplings is chosen as the benchmark model for this search. No statistically significant excess of events is observed in the data, and upper limits on the cross section times the branching ratio of W′R resonances at 95% C.L. lie in the range of 6.1–1.0 pb for W′R masses ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 TeV. These limits are translated into a lower bound on the allowed right-handed W′R mass, giving mW′R>1.13  TeV at 95% C.L."
doi_dedup___::9ebae9894ce064c61aa171690b1cf6ff,"Now that conventional weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter searches are approaching the neutrino floor, there has been a resurgence of interest in detectors with sensitivity to nuclear recoil directions. A large-scale directional detector is attractive in that it would have sensitivity below the neutrino floor, be capable of unambiguously establishing the galactic origin of a purported dark matter signal, and could serve a dual purpose as a neutrino observatory. We present the first detailed analysis of a 1000 m$^3$-scale detector capable of measuring a directional nuclear recoil signal at low energies. We propose a modular and multi-site observatory consisting of time projection chambers (TPCs) filled with helium and SF$_6$ at atmospheric pressure. Depending on the TPC readout technology, 10-20 helium recoils above 6 keVr or only 3-4 recoils above 20 keVr would suffice to distinguish a 10 GeV WIMP signal from the solar neutrino background. High-resolution charge readout also enables powerful electron background rejection capabilities well below 10 keV. We detail background and site requirements at the 1000 m$^3$-scale, and identify materials that require improved radiopurity. The final experiment, which we name CYGNUS-1000, will be able to observe 10-40 neutrinos from the Sun, depending on the final energy threshold. With the same exposure, the sensitivity to spin independent cross sections will extend into presently unexplored sub-10 GeV parameter space. For spin dependent interactions, already a 10 m$^3$-scale experiment could compete with upcoming generation-two detectors, but CYGNUS-1000 would improve upon this considerably. Larger volumes would bring sensitivity to neutrinos from an even wider range of sources, including galactic supernovae, nuclear reactors, and geological processes."

We show that it captures the expressive power of the vertical fragment of XPath - containing the child, descendant, parent and ancestor axes - obtaining thus a decision procedure for its satisfiability problem."

In one spatial dimension, numerical analysis are performed by considering harmonic chains with either periodic or Dirichlet boundary conditions. In the massless regime and for some configurations where the subsystem is a single interval, the numerical results for the contour function are compared to the inverse of the local weight function which multiplies the energy-momentum tensor in the corresponding entanglement hamiltonian, found through conformal field theory methods, and a good agreement is observed.

Using a large database that covers international R&D collaborations from 1984 to 2009, we localize each actor precisely in space through its latitude and longitude. This allows us to analyze the R&D network at all geographic scales simultaneously. Our empirical results show that despite the high importance of the city level, transnational R&D collaborations at large distances are much more frequent than expected from similar networks. This provides evidence for the ambiguity of distance in economic cooperation which is also suggested by the existing literature. In addition we test whether the hypothesis of local buzz and global pipelines applies to the observed R&D network by calculating well-defined metrics from network theory."

We map the spatial pattern of the Bi impurity state, which originates from Bi atoms down to the sixth layer below the surface, in topographic, filled state X-STM images on the natural $\\{110\\}$ cleavage planes. The Bi impurity state has a highly anisotropic bowtie-like structure and extends over several lattice sites. These Bi-induced charge redistributions extend along the $\\left\\langle 110\\right\\rangle$ directions, which define the bowtie-like structures we observe. Local tight-binding calculations reproduce the experimentally observed spatial structure of the Bi impurity state. In addition, the influence of the Bi atoms on the electronic structure is investigated in scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements. These measurements show that Bi induces a resonant state in the valence band, which shifts the band edge towards higher energies. This is in good agreement to first principles calculations. Furthermore, we show that the energetic position of the Bi induced resonance and its influence on the onset of the valence band edge depend crucially on the position of the Bi atoms relative to the cleavage plane."

Usually, to decide where to sort an object, the system needs to solve either an instance retrieval (known object) or a supervised classification (predefined set of classes) problem. In this paper, we introduce a new decision making module, where the robotic system chooses how to sort the objects in an unsupervised way. We call this problem Unsupervised Robotic Sorting (URS) and propose an implementation on an industrial robotic system, using deep CNN feature extraction and standard clustering algorithms. We carry out extensive experiments on various standard datasets to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed image clustering pipeline. To evaluate the robustness of our URS implementation, we also introduce a complex real world dataset containing images of objects under various background and lighting conditions. This dataset is used to fine tune the design choices (CNN and clustering algorithm) for URS. Finally, we propose a method combining our pipeline with ensemble clustering to use multiple images of each object. This redundancy of information about the objects is shown to increase the clustering results."

doi_dedup___::fbb11d7c06c7e9eb325dd2081a59ccf1,"We present a novel full-waveform inversion (FWI) approach which can reduce the computational cost by up to an order of magnitude compared to conventional approaches, provided that variations in medium properties are sufficiently smooth. Our method is based on the usage of wavefield adapted meshes which accelerate the forward and adjoint wavefield simulations. By adapting the mesh to the expected complexity and smoothness of the wavefield, the number of elements needed to discretize the wave equation can be greatly reduced. This leads to spectral-element meshes which are optimally tailored to source locations and medium complexity. We demonstrate a workflow which opens up the possibility to use these meshes in FWI and show the computational advantages of the approach. We provide examples in 2-D and 3-D to illustrate the concept, describe how the new workflow deviates from the standard FWI workflow, and explain the additional steps in detail."

Prior works have derived closed-form SE bounds and approximations for Gaussian distributed channels, while we consider the double scattering model-a prime example of a non-Gaussian channel for which it is intractable to obtain closed form SE expressions. The channels are estimated using limited resources, which gives rise to pilot contamination, and the estimates are used for linear detection and to compute the SE numerically. Analytical and numerical examples are used to describe the key behaviors of the double scattering models, which differ from conventional Massive MIMO models. Finally, we provide multi-cell simulation results that compare the double scattering model with uncorrelated Rayleigh fading and explain under what conditions we can expect to achieve similar SEs."

As most X-ray transients, it was discovered at the beginning of an X-ray outburst. After the initial canonical X-ray hard state, the outburst evolved into a hard intermediate state and then went back to the hard state. The existing RATAN-600 radio monitoring observations revealed that it was variable on a timescale of days and had a flat or inverted spectrum, consistent with optically thick synchrotron emission, possibly from a self-absorbed jet in the vicinity of the central compact object. We observed the transient in the hard state near the end of the X-ray outburst with the European VLBI Network (EVN) at 5 GHz and the Chinese VLBI Network (CVN) at 2.3 and 8.3 GHz. The 8.3 GHz observations were carried out at a recording rate of 2048 Mbps using the newly-developed Chinese VLBI data acquisition system (CDAS), twice higher than the recording rate used in the other observations.

doi_dedup___::bfb776bf48bec26d6397c1f18b5ce2b1,"Gravitational lensing is a powerful tool for constraining substructure in the mass distribution of galaxies, be it from the presence of dark matter sub-halos or due to physical mechanisms affecting the baryons throughout galaxy evolution. Such substructure is hard to model and is either ignored by traditional, smooth modelling, approaches, or treated as well-localized massive perturbers. In this work, we propose a deep learning approach to quantify the statistical properties of such perturbations directly from images, where only the extended lensed source features within a mask are considered, without the need of any lens modelling. Our training data consist of mock lensed images assuming perturbing Gaussian Random Fields permeating the smooth overall lens potential, and, for the first time, using images of real galaxies as the lensed source. We employ a novel deep neural network that can handle arbitrary uncertainty intervals associated with the training dataset labels as input, provides probability distributions as output, and adopts a composite loss function. The method succeeds not only in accurately estimating the actual parameter values, but also reduces the predicted confidence intervals by 10 per cent in an unsupervised manner, i.e., without having access to the actual ground truth values. Our results are invariant to the inherent degeneracy between mass perturbations in the lens and complex brightness profiles for the source. Hence, we can quantitatively and robustly quantify the smoothness of the mass density of thousands of lenses, including confidence intervals, and provide a consistent ranking for follow-up science."
doi_dedup___::bce9710594dc5c10a8694bb785020fd5,"Recent experimental studies of magnetic domain expansion under easy-axis drive fields in materials with a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy have shown that the domain wall velocity is asymmetric as a function of an external in plane magnetic field. This is understood as a consequence of the inversion asymmetry of the system, yielding a finite chiral Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Numerous attempts have been made to explain these observations using creep theory, but, in doing so, these have not included all contributions to the domain wall energy or have introduced additional free parameters. In this article we present a theory for creep motion of chiral domain walls in the creep regime that includes the most important contributions to the domain-wall energy and does not introduce new free parameters beyond the usual parameters that are included in the micromagnetic energy. Furthermore, we present experimental measurements of domain wall velocities as a function of in-plane field that are well decribed by our model, and from which material properties such as the strength of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and the demagnetization field are extracted."
doi_dedup___::40129918c9f35abb0b5c05b6d297b961,"Methods for reconstructing the topology of complex networks from time-resolved observations of node dynamics are gaining relevance across scientific disciplines. Of biggest practical interest are methods that make no assumptions about properties of the dynamics, and can cope with noisy, short and incomplete trajectories. Ideal reconstruction in such scenario requires and exhaustive approach of simulating the dynamics for all possible network configurations and matching the simulated against the actual trajectories, which of course is computationally too costly for any realistic application. Relying on insights from equation discovery and machine learning, we here introduce \\textit{decoupling approximation} of dynamical networks and propose a new reconstruction method based on it. Decoupling approximation consists of matching the simulated against the actual trajectories for each node individually rather than for the entire network at once. Despite drastic reduction of the computational cost that this approximation entails, we find our method's performance to be very close to that of the ideal method. In particular, we not only make no assumptions about properties of the trajectories, but provide strong evidence that our methods' performance is largely independent of the dynamical regime at hand. Of crucial relevance for practical applications, we also find our method to be extremely robust to both length and resolution of the trajectories and relatively insensitive to noise."

The recently discovered flat electronic bands and strongly correlated and superconducting phases in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG)1,2 crucially depend on the interlayer twist angle, θ. Although control of the global θ with a precision of about 0.1 degrees has been demonstrated1–7, little information is available on the distribution of the local twist angles. Here we use a nanoscale on-tip scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID-on-tip)8 to obtain tomographic images of the Landau levels in the quantum Hall state9 and to map the local θ variations in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)-encapsulated MATBG devices with relative precision better than 0.002 degrees and a spatial resolution of a few moiré periods. We find a correlation between the degree of θ disorder and the quality of the MATBG transport characteristics and show that even state-of-the-art devices—which exhibit correlated states, Landau fans and superconductivity—display considerable local variation in θ of up to 0.1 degrees, exhibiting substantial gradients and networks of jumps, and may contain areas with no local MATBG behaviour. We observe that the correlated states in MATBG are particularly fragile with respect to the twist-angle disorder. We also show that the gradients of θ generate large gate-tunable in-plane electric fields, unscreened even in the metallic regions, which profoundly alter the quantum Hall state by forming edge channels in the bulk of the sample and may affect the phase diagram of the correlated and superconducting states. We thus establish the importance of θ disorder as an unconventional type of disorder enabling the use of twist-angle gradients for bandstructure engineering, for realization of correlated phenomena and for gate-tunable built-in planar electric fields for device applications."

Sixty-three full sibling pairs played for money in a one-shot trust game.

doi_dedup___::b7d501c7e6c962f07c1784009c669e35,"Conceived in the early 1990s, Experience Replay (ER) has been shown to be a successful mechanism to allow online learning algorithms to reuse past experiences. Traditionally, ER can be applied to all machine learning paradigms (i.e., unsupervised, supervised, and reinforcement learning). Recently, ER has contributed to improving the performance of deep reinforcement learning. Yet, its application to many practical settings is still limited by the memory requirements of ER, necessary to explicitly store previous observations. To remedy this issue, we explore a novel approach, Online Contrastive Divergence with Generative Replay (OCD_GR), which uses the generative capability of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) instead of recorded past experiences. The RBM is trained online, and does not require the system to store any of the observed data points. We compare OCD_GR to ER on 9 real-world datasets, considering a worst-case scenario (data points arriving in sorted order) as well as a more realistic one (sequential random-order data points). Our results show that in 64.28% of the cases OCD_GR outperforms ER and in the remaining 35.72% it has an almost equal performance, while having a considerably reduced space complexity (i.e., memory usage) at a comparable time complexity."
